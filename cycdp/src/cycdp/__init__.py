"""
cycdp - Python bindings for CDP audio processing library.

Example usage:
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import cycdp
    >>> samples = np.array([0.5, 0.3, -0.2], dtype=np.float32)
    >>> cycdp.gain(samples, gain_factor=2.0)
    array([1. , 0.6, -0.4], dtype=float32)
    >>> cycdp.normalize(samples, target=1.0)
    array([1. , 0.6, -0.4], dtype=float32)
